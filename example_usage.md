### Example 2: Technical Photography Questions

**Input:**
```
What camera settings work best for intimate photography with natural lighting?
```

**Expected Response:**
```
For intimate photography with natural lighting, here are optimal camera settings:

**Aperture (f-stop):**
- f/1.4 - f/2.8 for shallow depth of field and subject isolation
- f/4 - f/5.6 if you need more of the subject in focus
- Avoid f/8+ unless you specifically want everything sharp

**ISO Settings:**
- Keep as low as possible (ISO 100-400) for best image quality
- ISO 800-1600 acceptable in lower light
- Modern cameras handle ISO 3200+ well if needed

**Shutter Speed:**
- 1/125s minimum for handheld shots
- 1/250s+ for any movement
- Use tripod for slower speeds in low light

**Focus:**
- Single-point autofocus for precision
- Focus on the eyes when shooting portraits
- Use back-button focus for better control

**Natural Light Tips:**
- Window light is often the most flattering
- Avoid direct sunlight - use sheer curtains to diffuse
- Golden hour (sunrise/sunset) provides warm, romantic lighting
- Overcast days give beautiful, even lighting

**Camera Modes:**
- Aperture Priority (A/Av) mode for depth of field control
- Manual mode when lighting is consistent
- Shoot in RAW format for maximum editing flexibility
